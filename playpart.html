    <p>[Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:]</p>
     <p>Upon my word, I don't believe they are stirring yet! </p>


<h6>BERTA.</h6>

<p>[Also softly.]</p>
<p>I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.</p>


<h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>

<p>well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.</p>

     <p></p>[She goes to the glass door and throws it open.]</p>


<h6>BERTA.</h6>

<p>[Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]</p>
<p>I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
Miss.</p> 
<p>[She places it on the piano.]</p>


<h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6> 

<p>So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
wrench to me to part with you.</p>


<h6>BERTA.</h6>

<p>[On the point of weeping.]</p> 
<p>And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1) </p>


<h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6> 

<p>We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
to look after him ever since he was a little boy. </p>
