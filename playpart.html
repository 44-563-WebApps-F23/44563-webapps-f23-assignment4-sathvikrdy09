       <b>MISS TESMAN.</b><br>

[Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:] Upon my word, I
don't believe they are stirring yet! <br>


<b>BERTA.</b> <br>

[Also softly.] I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed. <br>


<b>MISS TESMAN.</b> <br>

Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.

     [She goes to the glass door and throws it open. <br>


<b>BERTA.</b> <br>

[Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]
I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
Miss. [She places it on the piano. <br>


<b>MISS TESMAN.</b> <br>

So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
wrench to me to part with you. <br>


<b>BERTA.</b><br>

[On the point of weeping.] And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1) <br>


<b>MISS TESMAN.</b> <br>

We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
to look after him ever since he was a little boy. <br>
